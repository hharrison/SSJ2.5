\defclass {MathFunction}

This interface should be implemented by classes which represent univariate 
mathematical functions. It is used to pass an arbitrary function of one 
variable as argument to another function. For example, it is used
in \externalclass{umontreal.iro.lecuyer.util}{RootFinder} to find
 the zeros of a function.
