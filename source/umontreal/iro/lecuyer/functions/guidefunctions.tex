\title{functions}{Functions utilities}

\vfill
This package contains a few utilities classes representing univariate 
mathematical functions. They are useful, for example, when one wants to pass
an arbitrary function of one variable as argument to a method.
They allow one to apply mathematical operations like squaring, power, etc.
on generic functions. There are also utilities for numerical
differentiation and integration.
