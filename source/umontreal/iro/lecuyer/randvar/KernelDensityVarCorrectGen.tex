\defclass{KernelDensityVarCorrectGen}

This class is a variant of \class{KernelDensityGen}{}, but with
a rescaling of the empirical distribution so that the variance
of the density used to generate the random variates is equal
to the empirical variance,
 as suggested by \latex{\cite{tSIL86a}}\html{Silverman}.

Let $\bar x_n$ and $s_n^2$ be the sample mean and sample variance 
of the observations.
The distance between each generated random variate and the 
sample mean $\bar x_n$ is multiplied by the correcting factor
$1/\sigma_e$, where $\sigma_e^2 = 1 + (h\sigma_k/s_n)^2$.
The constant $\sigma_k^2$ must be passed to the constructor.
Its value can be found in \latex{Table~\ref{tab:kernels}}
\html{the Table in \class{KernelDensityGen}{}} for some popular
kernels.
