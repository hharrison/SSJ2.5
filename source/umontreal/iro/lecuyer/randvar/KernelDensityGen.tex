\defclass{KernelDensityGen}

This class implements random variate generators for distributions
obtained via \emph{kernel density estimation} methods from a set of
$n$ individual observations $x_1,\dots,x_n$
\cite{tDEV85a,rDEV86a,rHOR00a,rHOR04a,tSIL86a}. 
The basic idea is to center a copy of the same symmetric density 
at each observation and take an equally weighted mixture of the $n$
copies as an estimator of the density from which the observations come.
The resulting kernel density has the general form
\begin{latexonly}
\eq
 f_n(x) = \frac{1}{nh} \sum_{i=1}^n k((x-x_i)/h),
\endeq
\end{latexonly}%
\begin{htmlonly}
\eq
 f_n(x) = (1/nh) \sum_{i=1}^n k((x-x_i)/h),
\endeq
\end{htmlonly}%
where $k$ is a fixed pre-selected density called the {\em kernel\/} 
and $h$ is a positive constant called the \emph{bandwidth} or
\emph{smoothing factor}.
A difficult practical issue is the selection of $k$ and $h$.
Several approaches have been proposed for that; see, e.g., 
\cite{tBER94a,tCAO94a,rHOR04a,tSIL86a}.

The constructor of a generator from a kernel density requires a
random stream $s$, the $n$ observations in the form of an empirical
distribution, a random variate generator for the kernel density $k$,
and the value of the bandwidth $h$.
The random variates are then generated as follows:
select an observation $x_I$ at random, by inversion, using stream $s$,
then generate random variate $Y$ with the generator provided for
the density $k$, and return $x_I + hY$.

A simple formula for the bandwidth, suggested in \cite{tSIL86a,rHOR04a},
is $h = \alpha_k h_0$, where
\eq
 h_0 = 1.36374 \min(s_n, q / 1.34) n^{-1/5}, \label{eq:bandwidth0}
\endeq
$s_n$ and $q$ are the empirical standard deviation and the 
interquartile range of the $n$ observations,
and $\alpha_k$ is a constant that depends on the type of kernel $k$.
It is defined by
\eq
 \alpha_k = \left(\sigma_k^{-4} \int_{-\infty}^\infty k(x)dx \right)^{1/5} 
\endeq
where $\sigma_k$ is the standard deviation of the density $k$.
The static method \method{getBaseBandwidth}{} permits one to compute $h_0$ 
for a given empirical distribution.

\begin{tabular}{llccc}

 boxcar       &\texttt{UniformDist(-1, 1)}            & 1.3510 & 1/3 & 0.930\\
 logistic     &\texttt{LogisticDist()}                & 0.4340 &3.2899& 0.888\\
 Student-t(3) &\texttt{StudentDist(3)}                & 0.4802 & 3   & 0.674\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Table~\ref{tab:kernels} gives the precomputed values of $\sigma_k$ and
$\alpha_k$ for selected (popular) kernels.
The values are taken from \cite{rHOR04a}.
The second column gives the name of a function (in this package)
that constructs the corresponding distribution.
The \emph{efficiency} of a kernel is defined as the ratio of its
mean integrated square error over that of the Epanechnikov kernel,
which has optimal efficiency and corresponds to the beta distribution
with parameters $(2,2)$ over the interval $(-1,1)$.

  \begin{tabb}  Creates a new generator for a kernel density estimated 
    from the observations given by the empirical distribution \texttt{dist},
    using stream \texttt{s} to select the observations,
    generator \texttt{kGen} to generate the added noise from the kernel
    density, and bandwidth \texttt{h}.

  \begin{tabb}  
    This constructor uses a gaussian kernel and the default 
    bandwidth $h = \alpha_k h_0$ with the $\alpha_k$ 
    suggested in Table~\ref{tab:kernels} for the gaussian distribution.
    This kernel has an efficiency of 0.951.

  the \emph{reflection method}: replace all negative values by their
  \emph{absolute values}.
  That is, \method{nextDouble}{} will return $|x|$ if $x$ is the 
  generated variate.  The mecanism is disabled when the method is
  called with \texttt{false}.
